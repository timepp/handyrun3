# On System without UAC (or with UAC turned off)
there is always one HandyRun process.

# On System with UAC

- if a process is elevated, then it cannot become a drop target if the drop source is a normal process which is not elevated. 
- if a process is non-elevated, then it cannot serve double-press hotkeys if the foreground process is elevated.

so, a single process solution can not work perfectly in all cases. HandyRun uses multi-process model.

- if HandyRun starts elevated, it will launch a non-elevated copy. The elevated copy does not exit.
- if HandyRun starts non-elevated, when it needs long-term admin rights, such as handling the double-click hotkeys, it will ask the elevated copy to do it. If the elevated copy does not exist, it will launch a new elevated copy.

in all cases, the non-elevated copy become "HandyRun Main Process" -- HMP, which provides most functions, including show UI, display tray icon, etc. the elevated copy become "HandyRun Background Process" -- HBP, which provides functions need high priveledge, such as double-press key listener.

Although there may be an additional HandyRun process in the system, it won't take more memory. They has same binary, so the most memory is shared with each other.
