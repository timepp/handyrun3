* XP or below
there is always one HandyRun process.

* VISTA+
on vista+:
- if a process is elevated, then it cannot become a drop target if the drop source is a normal process which is not elevated. 
- if a process is non-elevated, then it cannot serve double-press hotkeys if the foreground process is elevated.

so, a single process solution can not work perfectly in all cases. HandyRun uses process-pair model(PPM).
- if HandyRun is started non-elevated, it will launch a elevated copy when necessary. All necessary cases are listed here: 1. if the hotkey is a double-press hotkey.
- if HandyRun is started elevated, it will always launch a non-elevated copy.
in all cases, the non-elevated copy become "HandyRun Main Process" -- HMP, which provides most functions, including show UI, display tray icon, etc. the elevated copy become "HandyRun Background Process" -- HBP, which provides functions need high priveledge, such as double-press key listener.
